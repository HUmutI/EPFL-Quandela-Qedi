## Quandela Challenge: Forecasting & Imputing Financial Markets

Team Qedi's solution for the Quandela Challenge at the EPFL Quantum Hackathon 2026. This repository contains our Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) based approach to predicting option prices and interpolating missing financial trajectories with high dimensionality and low volatility.

### ✨ The Approach
Instead of training millions of parameters in classical deep networks (like LSTMs) which suffer from data starvation and vanishing gradients, our Champion Hybrid Quantum Neural Network relies on the vast state space of quantum entanglement:

1.  **Dimensionality Compression (PCA)**: We reduce raw high-dimensional option data down into 6 key latent structural dimensions.
2.  **Hilbert Space Reservoir**: Time-series parameters are injected as Rx/Ry/Rz rotations directly into an exponentially deep entanglement loop on 6 qubits. 
3.  **Ridge Regression Alignment**: We efficiently extract patterns utilizing Ridge Regression over the measured states, heavily mitigating system noise. 
4.  **Direct Linear Readout**: By measuring Pauli-Z expectations, we train a strictly linear output layer, mathematically halting the overfitting trap that hinders classical algorithms on flat-volatility sets.

### 🏆 Results Summary
Tested autoregressively, our purely Hybrid-QNN solution effectively surpassed heavyweight classical baselines:
*   **Naive Baseline RMSE:** 0.0033
*   **Classical LSTM RMSE:** 0.0089 
*   **Champion Hybrid QNN RMSE:** 0.0083

It accurately maintained a <10% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) projection over an unseen 6-Day cascade!

### 💻 Repository Structure
- `train_final.py`: The core PyTorch + PennyLane machine learning engine. This file contains the architecture, classical PCA transformations, and the hybrid evaluation/training logic.
- `qedi_website/`: The source code for our interactive, static HTML/CSS/JS presentation website. Includes a QRC visual sandbox (Data Imputation Demo).
- `data/`: The training set for the Quandela challenge.
- `last/` & `logs/`: Autogenerated experiment results, logged terminal metrics, and plotted convergence graphics.

### 🚀 Running the Project

#### 1. Model Training
Requires `torch`, `pennylane`, and standard ML arrays (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).

```bash
# Activate your conda environment natively
conda activate quandela

# Execute the core engine train/eval routines
python train_final.py
```

#### 2. Local Website Deployment 
To run the fully functional static Pitch Deck locally for demo purposes:

```bash
cd qedi_website
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
